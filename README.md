# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Presentation

In this, I developed a Hand Gesture-Controlled Presentation System that combines computer vision with user-friendly interaction. It leverages OpenCV, hand gesture recognition, and multimedia tools to allow users to control PowerPoint presentations through gestures, without needing a physical device like a mouse or remote.
